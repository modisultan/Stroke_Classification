### Abstract:

The goal is of this project is to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke or not. 

### Design::

This project is one of the T5 Data Science Boot Camp requirements the data provided by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset">Kaggle</a>. 

### Data:
The data will be used in this project is provided by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset">Kaggle</a>. 
Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient, it contains of 5110 rows and 12 columns.

Columns contains:

1) id: unique identifier
2) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"

11) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not.
